My name is Tales da Rocha Trindade, I'm a 3D character artist based in Curitiba, Brazil.

I've been sculpting and developing characters since 2017 and I've worked with game, collectibles and advertising industries. I also lecture 3D and do workshops in the area.

If you liked my work or would like to talk about a collaborative project, DM me!
